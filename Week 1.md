# Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week did not involve any significant new or structured learning activities beyond the practical itself.  
Most of the work was focused on completing the Prac 1 task, with only minor reference to GitHub documentation when resolving a file path issue for GitHub Pages.

Other than that I did not use any other external tutorials or courses this week.

<1 hours of explicit learning

## Content Insights

This week primarily served as a refresher rather than introducing new concepts. Building and publishing a simple static website helped re-familiarise me with GitHub’s general workflow, particularly how repositories, commits, and GitHub Pages work together to publish static content.

I was reminded that even small details such as file paths and directory structure are important when deploying a website, especially when working with a hosted environment like GitHub Pages where errors are not always immediately obvious.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

For this first week, I did not gain any major new insights, as the tasks and tools used were relatively simple and familiar. However, completing the practical reinforced that I already have a reasonable baseline understanding of the very basics of HTML, CSS, and GitHub, which should be useful going into later weeks where more complex CMS and web development concepts will be introduced.
