# Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I spent some time watching a few short Joomla tutorial videos and using Google to understand how Joomla structures pages. I mainly looked up how articles, menus, and templates work, since this was confusing at first.

## Estimated Hours

1 - 2 hours of explicit learning

## Content Insights

I learned that Joomla does not use “pages” in the way some other site builders do. Instead, content is created as articles, and those articles only become visible on the site when they are linked through menu items. This was confusing at first because I created an article and could not find it anywhere on the live site. After learning how the menu system works, the structure made more sense.

I also learned where to change site titles, hide article metadata like the author, and adjust template settings so the site looks more realistic as to what its supposed to do.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This week showed me that I learn better by running into a problem first and then searching for a solution. Short videos and quick searches were more useful because they were directly related to what I was trying to fix at the time.
